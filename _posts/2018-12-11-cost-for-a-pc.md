## Initial cost for a gaming PC
>Gaming PC prices can range from $500 to $5000 dollars, you can see this as an investment or a waste of money. Some Gaming PCâ€™s are expensive due to the fact that the technology put into it is very good. As always you can build your own PC which cost around $800 to $1000 which isnâ€™t that bad, depends on what types of parts you buy for it. I recommend that you start off small and make your way up.

## What happens when something goes wrong?
>You can always buy warranty for your products which cost a little more money but itâ€™s better to have warranty than having to buy >it again.
